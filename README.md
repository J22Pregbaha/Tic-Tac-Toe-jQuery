# TicTacToe
> This is a simple game of Tic Tac Toe that I created with my javascript/jquery skills where you can play with another player or with the computer.

[Play the game here](https://j22pregbaha.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-jQuery/)

## TO-DO
* [X] Refactor code
* [X] Implement Minimax so computer plays good game (Please I need help with this. The minimax works but it doesn't work well and I don't know what to do to make it better. Thank you)
